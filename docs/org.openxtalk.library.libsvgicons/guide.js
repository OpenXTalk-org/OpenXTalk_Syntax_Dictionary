"data":"# libSVGicons\nThis is a library meant to compliment the IconSVG library in the IDE.\n\nA main feature is support for loading SVG Icon sets stored in a simple\ntab-seperated-values (TSV) list. These TSV Icon lists can be created from\n\"-webfont.svg\" formated font commonly found on the internet and supported by\ntools such as the cross-platform, open-source fontForge application.\n\nIncluded with the library are several liberally licensed Icon sets,\nthe biggest of these sets being Google's Material Icon project (v.4.0 currently).\nMaterial Icons set contains 6,063 glyphs so there may be a slight delay\n(0.5 second or so) when initially loading that set.\n\nTo facilitate browsing such a vast amount of SVG icons, OpenXTalk DPE now includes\na new palette called \"SVG Glyphs Browser\". For each IDE session, when the user opens\nthis palette, if the additional icon sets are not already loaded into memory,\na dialog will be presented asking if the additional icons sets should be loaded.\n\n![Glyphs Palette](images/SVGGlyphBrowser.jpg)\n\nThe icons can be drag-n-dropped from this palette onto a stack to place the icon onto a card.\n\nThe icons are loaded into memory in the same array format used by the IconSVG library and can be selected using icon-picker widget or used with any other mechanism designed to be compatible with the IconSVG library.\n\n![Icon Picker](images/icon-picker.png)\n"
