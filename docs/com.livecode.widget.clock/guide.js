"data":"# Clock Widget\nThe clock widget displays the current time in a given time zone, using\nan analog clock face.\n\n![Clock widget](images/clock.png)\n\n## Creating a Clock\nA clock widget can be created by dragging it out from the Tools\nPalette, where it appears with the following icon:\n\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 70 70\" style=\"display:block;margin:auto\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  <path d=\"M31.7,0C14.2,0,0,14.2,0,31.7s14.2,31.7,31.7,31.7s31.7-14.2,31.7-31.7S49.2,0,31.7,0z M30.2,3.2h2.8v7.3h-2.8V3.2zM10.4,33.1H3.1v-2.8h7.3V33.1z M12.5,52.9l-2-2l5.2-5.2l2,2L12.5,52.9z M15.7,17.7l-5.2-5.2l2-2l5.2,5.2L15.7,17.7z M33.1,60.2h-2.8v-7.3h2.8V60.2z M42.3,45.4L31.8,34.9c0,0-0.1,0-0.1,0c-1.7,0-3-1.3-3-3c0-1.1,0.6-2.1,1.6-2.6V12.9h2.8v16.3c0.9,0.5,1.6,1.5,1.6,2.6c0,0.2,0,0.4-0.1,0.5L45,42.8L42.3,45.4z M50.8,52.9l-5.2-5.2l2-2l5.2,5.2L50.8,52.9z M47.7,17.7l-2-2l5.2-5.2l2,2L47.7,17.7z M52.9,33.1v-2.8h7.3v2.8H52.9z\" />\n</svg>\n\n\nAlternatively it can be created in script using:\n\n\tcreate widget as \"com.livecode.widget.clock\"\n\n## Clock Display\n\nThe clock has two different styles, depending on whether it is day or\nnight. By default the hands are dark on a light background when displaying\na time at night (between 8PM and 6AM), and the hands are light on a dark\nbackground when displaying a time during the day.\n\n![AM PM clocks](images/clocks.png)\n\nThese colors can be customised using the `dayNumberColor`, `dayHourHandColor`, `dayMinuteHandColor`, `daySecondHandColor` and `dayFaceColor` properties,\nand the equivalent properties for night.\n\nThe read-only property `isDay` also reflects whether the current time is\nAM or PM.\n\nThe time displayed by the clock can differ from the current system local time by setting the timeZone property, an integer which adjusts the time displayed relative to universal time (UTC). For instance, to set the clock to display\na time that is 6 hours ahead of UCT time (\"+06:00\"):\n\n`set the timeZone of widget \"Clock\" to 21600`\n\nas 21600 seconds is 6 hours.\n"
