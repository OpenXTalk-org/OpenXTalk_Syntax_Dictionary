It can also be set to a local file \nurl.\n\nAlternatively the `htmlText` property can be used to render specific \nchunks of html within the browser object. \n\n## Controlling Navigation\nThe browser sends the following messages which can be used to control navigation within the browser. See the API documentation for more details:\n\n* browserDocumentLoadBegin\n* browserDocumentLoadComplete\n* browserDocumentLoadFailed\n* browserFrameDocumentLoadBegin\n* browserFrameDocumentLoadComplete\n* browserFrameDocumentLoadFailed\n* browserNavigateBegin\n* browserNavigateComplete\n* browserNavigateFailed\n* browserUnhandledLoadRequest\n\n## Interacting With JavaScript\nThe browser allows two-way interaction with the javascript running in \nthe displayed page. To allow LiveCode handlers to be called from \nJavaScript, there is a `javascriptHandlers` property. This can be set to\na list of LiveCode handlers which appear as methods attached to a global \n`liveCode` object. You can call these methods as you would any other \nJavaScript function and pass whatever parameters you require.\n\nIn the other direction, you can use the `do in widget` command to \nexecute JavaScript statements in a browser widget. For example:\n\n\t-- Use JavaScript to hide \"myButton\" in the page displayed in a browser widget.\n\tdo \"document.getElementById('myButton').hidden = 'hidden'\" in widget \"myBrowser\""
